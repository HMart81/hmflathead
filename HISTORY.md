## hmflathead history

hmflathead (naming things is hard...) development started in December 2024 by me, Hilario Martins. The objective was to train programming, game especially, learn basic 2D engine development, and finally test and learn the C3 programming language. 
Because this was intended mostly as a test bed for the C3 programming language, the engine started as a bunch of random pieces of code, so there's no real design document or architecture for it, so it's a mess of code. 
Because of this fact, for a very long time, I didn't want to make it public, but in February 2025, I decided to grow a pair and release it, as is, to the public, bugs, ugly code, bad logic and all.

This is all in the hope that despite this work not being that good, it doesn't go all to waste; someone other than me may find it useful for something; at least IMO it can be considered a more complex test bed for the C3 language than a simple hello world program.

Why GPL and not a more permissive license?
One because I have worked mostly with GPL code myself, and second, if someone else uses this, I do want them to give something back to the project. If you cannot work with GPL code, then be free to ignore this repository.

Lastly, this engine **is not finished** for now, I will keep working on it for as long as I can and so you should expect to have bugs, I will also claim it is **not in a compilable state** because I add to remove some dependencies to put this in GitHub, again if that is not something you like, be free to ignore this engine and repository.

Cheers to all, 
   
Hilario Martins

**ps:** This file may be updated or removed in its entirety in the future, if the engine state changes in any significant way.
